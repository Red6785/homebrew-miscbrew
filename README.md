# Red6785 Miscbrew

A personal collection of un-notarized Homebrew Casks for applications I personally use.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install red6785/miscbrew/<formula>`

Or `brew tap red6785/miscbrew` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "red6785/miscbrew"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation
